'''Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other 
N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."'''


class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        cit = sorted(citations)
        n = len(cit)
        h = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if cit[i] >= n - i:
                return n - i
        return h
